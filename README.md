# volleyball-stats
A Python program I wrote in high school using the TkInter GUI library and CSV library that drastically improved the process of jotting stats for our volleyball team.

User changes the roster text file to add or remove players (Last, First JerseyNumber).
User can input name of Opposing Team
To add a stat to a player, user inputs the jersey number of desired player and presses Enter, then they can use the buttons on the main interface to add stats.

Game Flow will show the user a simple graph representation of the current game's scoring between the two teams.

The End button will create a new CSV spreadsheet containing all the players in the roster and their corresponding stats in the recorded game.
Files will be named "YYYY-MM-DD vs. OpposingTeam Set Number"
